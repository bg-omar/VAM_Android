# Constants
hbar = 1.054571817e-34  # Planck's constant / (2 * pi), in Js
c = 3e8  # Speed of light in m/s
G = 6.67430e-11  # Gravitational constant in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
e_mass = 9.10938356e-31  # Mass of an electron in kg
p_mass = 1.6726219e-27  # Mass of a proton in kg
t_p = 5.391247e-44  # Planck time in seconds

# Energy equivalence for photon-electron interaction (using E = mc^2)
def energy_mass(mass):
  return mass * c**2

# Gravitational force between electron and proton (F = G * m1 * m2 / r^2)
def gravitational_force(m1, m2, r):
  return G * m1 * m2 / r**2

# Distance between electron and proton (arbitrary assumption for calculation purposes)
r = 5.29e-11  # Approximately Bohr radius in meters

# Energy required to pull electron and proton together using gravitational force
F_g = gravitational_force(e_mass, p_mass, r)

# Check energy equivalence for photon-electron interaction:
# Calculating the photon energy equivalent to the transient mass

# Assume the photon energy (E = h * nu) or from the transient mass for one Planck time
transient_mass = F_g / c**2  # Inferring mass from gravitational force
transient_energy = energy_mass(transient_mass)  # Corresponding energy

# Printing the results
